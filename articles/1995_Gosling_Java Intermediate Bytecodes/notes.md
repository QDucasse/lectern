Java emerged from its divergences with C++ by using a compiler to generate byte coded machine independent instructions. While this type of method is usually unsuitable for higher-level manipulation, some twists are used: unusual amount of **type information**, **restrictions on the use of the operand stack** and heavy reliance on **symbolic references** and **on-the-fly code rewriting**. 

Instruction definitions follow this inductive property: *Given only the type state before the execution of the instruction, the type state afterwards is determined*.  Smalltalk or PostScript stack-based codes do not have this property. The main idea behind this specification is **simplicity**.

In conjunction, instructions follow the property: *When there are two execution paths into the same point, they must arrive there with exactly the same type state*. This means that bytecode generators cannot write loops that iterate through arrays copying each element on the stack. Since all paths to a point are required to arrive with the same type state, then the type state from any incoming path can be used to do further manipulations.

These restrictions allow a number of important consequences:

- **Static checkability**: The last phase of the bytecode loader is the **verifier**, it traverses the bytecode, constructs type state information and verifies the type parameters of all opcodes. Once the **verifier** finishes, it is guaranteed that: there are no operand stack overflows or underflows, the types of the parameters of opcodes is correct, no illegal data conversions are done and object field accesses are legal. It helps the interpreter and provides a secure environment (no pointer can be forged, access restrictions are enforced, etc.).
- **Fragile Superclasses**: Java uses symbolic references to answer the issue. For example, the `getfield` opcode does not use an offset into the object but rather an index into the symbol table. Once the class is loaded, the offset into the object does not change. When the `getfield` opcode is executed, the interpreter looks up the symbol, finds its offset then rewrites the instruction to be a quick `getfield` with the exact offset.
- **Portability**: Compiled programs are portable given the end device has an interpreter.
- **Translation to machine code**: The static nature of the type states enable simple on-the-fly translation of bytecodes into machine code (no dynamic checks or inferences).



A deterministic stack type-state restriction and a bytecode IR allow the bytecoded program to be compact then directly interpreted or translated to machine code. The implementation of these manipulations can be simple, fast and small.
