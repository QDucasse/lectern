Presentation of **Truffle DSL**, where a *guest VM* runs on top of a *host VM*. The *guest language* is the language we want to implement an application in while the *host language* is the language the *guest VM* is written in. 

The *guest language*  implementation is written as an abstract tree interpreter. The ability to replace one AST node with another is a key aspect of **Truffle**. The executed AST is improved at runtime by replacing nodes by more specialized ones based on profiling feedback. This specialized node makes *assumptions* about its operands for future executions. The implementation of the execution semantics *checks that all assumptions still hold then performs the operation*. If the assumptions do not hold, it replaces itself with a more generic version of the same node.

A dynamic compiler speculates the AST is stable (no node rewriting) and it compiles the interpreter `execute` method of the root node then recursively inlines the `execute` methods of all children. Speculation failures are handled using *deoptimization*, the compiled code is discarded and execution continues in the AST interpreter.

**Node Rewriting:** If a node cannot handle an operation, it replaces itself and lets the new node handle the input. The node replacement depends on (1) **Completeness**, it must provide rewrites for *all* cases that it does not handle itself and (2) **Finiteness**, after a finite number of node replacements, the operation must end up in a state that handles the full semantics without further rewrites. Before a node is executed, its state is *uninitialized*. If no specialization is found its state is *generic*.

**Express Specializations:** Separate the full semantics of an operation into multiple specializations helps encapsulating behavior and allows the compiler to write small and fast machine code. The implementation of a specialization consists of two parts: (1) **Checks that all inputs are as expected** and performs **node rewriting if not** (2) **Performs the actual operation**. If an operation works for a given specialization on all occurrences, it is a *monomorphic call*. If it varies between different inputs, we cannot change the node every now and then since it would violate the *finiteness principle*. A *Polymorphic node* is needed. This polymorphic call is represented by a node containing all encountered types.

*EXAMPLES RUN THROUGH THE TRUFFLE SYNTAX AND PRESENT ITS ANNOTATIONS*

**Truffle DSL** designed following three principles: (1) Declarative (2) Facilitate Optimizations (3) Interoperability. The DSL elements are Java annotations on classes and methods. The classes are used for two different kinds of DSL root elements. The specialization mechanism is used through *guards*. Guards can be applied as *type guards* that assume the type of a child value, *method guards* that assume the return value of a user-defined to be `true` or *event guards* in case an exception is thrown in the specialization body.

Several optimizations are enabled: 

- **Type check Elimination:** A node may ask a child node to return its data with a specific type by assigning a static type to the return value. This way, either the type is correct or an exception containing the resulting type is produced if the type is not correct.
- **Specialization Reduction:** As soon as an operation gets polymorphic, it is worthwhile to evaluate if a single more generic specialization leads to better code than a chain of monomorphic specializations. The `cost` option of specializations can be used to choose to replace with a more generic option. It is obtained from the sum of all specializations' `costs`.
- **Guard Reduction:** Types and method guards are executed while the polymorphic chain of specializations is traversed. These guards are represented with constant boolean values and an `@Implies` annotation is used to prove that a Java guard method implies another.
