### Defense Summary

***Execute no Read (XnR)*** is a new primitive that ensures the code can still be executed by the processor but cannot be read as data. 

### Attacker Threat Model

The attacker consists of a user mode process that contains a memory corruption vulnerability. The objective of the attacker is to exploit this vulnerability to divert the control flow and execute arbitrary code. The attacker knows the process' binary executable and the OS version of the attacked system so they can precompute potential gadget chains in advance. The process also has at least one memory disclosure  which makes the process read from an arbitrary memory location.

### Recipe

### Tools and Setup

No hardware support but emulation in software. Extension of the *page fault handler*. If an access to data requires a read and is indeed a data area it will be processed, if it is code it will be killed. This is in addition to ***demand paging*** that only allocates on data memory on demand.
