**The size of Java classfiles** has long been recognized as an issue, especially for embedded devices. Several methods exist to reduce the size, both as a transmission format and as an execution format. Some methods try to perturb the Java execution engine as little as possible while the **Java Card Paradigm introduces a muscular transformer between classfiles and interpreter.**

The projectâ€™s main goal of building a CLDC-compliant system on a small device led to a few straightforward consequent goals, namely *minimizing the size of transmitted classfiles*, the *RAM needed for classfile loading*, the *size of loaded classfiles*, the *RAM required during execution*, and the *size of the interpreter and memory system*.

These goals are then translated in design choices:

- Standard CLDC classfiles are too large and complex. Using a **Java Card** technique, they are **preprocessed off-device** and packaged in a smaller representation (*suite*) that can be verified and loaded on-device.
- The **classfile preprocesor** identifies code snippets that are hard to verify or garbage collect and translates them into simpler versions
- Standard classfiles contain symbolic information for resolving references. **References are now resolved before execution**, either during off-device translation or during the installation of suites on the device.
- Standard construction and **object initialization is recasted** into an equivalent form that can be verified more efficiently
- Three memory spaces are available with different characteristics. A **region-aware memory manager** is therefore used.



Bytecode verification and exact garbage collection are complex on small devices, especially due to the fact that pointers are hard to find and track. While CLDC added a classfile attribute called a *stackmap*, it is too complex and memory intensive. Specific restrictions are added to the translator and applied when the conversion from classfiles to *suites* is performed:

- **A local variable can only hold one type**
- **The evaluation stack must be empty at the end of a basic block**
- **Bytecodes that can trigger a GC may only be executed when the evaluation stack contains only the operands for those bytecodes**



A compact bytecode set is used with **reduced operand field sizes** that can then be extended (8 bits by default but that can be extended to 12, 16 or 32). Local variables are explicitly typed so **no type-specific load and store are needed**. Symbolic references (through a name string rather than an index or pointer) are **resolved as much as possible** when they are written into the memory of the target device **during loading**. A **field access** can be resolved to an **absolute offset within an object**, a **method invocation** to an **offset in a vtable**. Simple two-pass verification process. First step reads the bytecode and verifies **type safety**, **class member references** and writes them in NVM. Second pass checks the **branch targets** are valid.

Standard Java object construction creates an *uninitialized* object and then fills it up. Squawk does not expose uninitialized object references to the bytecode. The **object method constructor creates the object and returns the address of the newly created object**. A *null* flag is used as the first parameter. A constructor will allocate an object and replace the first parameter only if that parameter is *null*.



**Memory:**

- Three memory spaces: *RAM*, *NVM* and *ROM*. Objects in less permanent memory are allowed to contain references to objets in more permanent memory but not the other way around.
- *Chunky stack* composed of chunks allocated in the *RAM heap*. Each chunk is a Java object and can be GC'd.
- Class definition information is divided into *immutable* and *mutable*. All objects have a one-word header pointing to the immutable class information for that object.
- *Object monitors* are used to implement synchronization. The monitors are placed in an LRU queue in RAM. All monitors keep a reference to their corresponding objects.

**Implementation:**

- *Methods* are *byte arrays*
- Every class contains a *reference to a byte array that contains an object pointer map* used by the GC
- A class state record is the mutable part of a class definition, it contains the object reference fields and the integer fields used to hold the static variables of the class. The class state records are kept in an LRU queue in the RAM.

Garbage collection is performed when the `interpret` method fails and outputs an `OutOfMemory` error. The `gc()` method is only called when it fails to allocate a stack chunk, when it fails to allocate an object or when it is explicitly called:

```java
for (;;) {
	interpret(result);
	result = gc();
}
```
